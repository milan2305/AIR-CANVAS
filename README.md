# AIR-CANVAS
This is a simple project based on simple computer vision and complex mathematics, that enable us to write in the air with the use of finger . This project is made to find an alternative of the costly screen that are being used to write/draw in the online teaching centers. With this project, user can write/draw on the screen by simply moving index finger in air while facing a camera in a live video. The program also enables user to choose between different coloured pens and eraser. With further modifications in the project, the writings can be saved as image or pdfs as notes.
